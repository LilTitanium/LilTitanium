👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Joseph (Lil T) — a highly motivated and hands-on Cybersecurity and Network Administration professional with a passion for protecting systems, optimizing networks, and automating IT workflows.

🎓 I hold a Master’s in Cybersecurity Management and Data Analytics, a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity, and an Associate’s in Computer Network Engineering and System Administration, along with multiple Microsoft certifications covering Cloud, Security, Windows Server, Windows 10, and Mobile Device Management.

⚙️ I’ve built and maintained my own servers from OS installation to advanced configurations such as VPN setups and network segmentation. I also design PowerShell scripts that automate complex tasks like data migration and secure deletion for both private companies and government clients, saving time and minimizing human error.

💡 I’m known as the “Energizer Bunny” among peers — always learning, always building, and always moving forward. My ideal workspace? Working on IT projects by the beach, laptop open, Pina Colada in hand 🏝️.
