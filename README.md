- 👋 Hi, my name is Joseph, but I also go by Lil T.
- 👀 I have a Master's in Cybersecurity Management and Data Analytics, a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity, an Associate's in Computer Network Engineering and System administration, along with 
several Microsoft certifications: Cloud, security, Windows Server, Windows 10, Mobile Device Management, and more. During my academic career, I have been known as the "Energizer Bunny."
because I always like to be on "go go go" status, and I have high octane levels of energy and endurance. One of my hobbies is writing computer code, working on projects, pursuing technical certifications, traveling, and anything else. My paradise work environment is to do IT-related work at the beach while having my Pina Coladas. Overall, I always enjoy working on computers. I have built my one servers from installation of the operating system to advanced network configurations such as Virtual Private Networks.
- There are quite a few Powerscripts I have built to automate the data migration process and deletion. The scripts I have written were for private companies and the  government sector. I have created these automation scripts because when I have migrated masses amounts of files to other locations, it became tedious and time-consuming.
