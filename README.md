- 👋 Hi, my name is Joseph, but I also go by Lil T.
- 👀 I have Master's in Cybersecurity Management and Data Analytics, Bachelor's in Cybersecurity, Associate's in Computer Network Engineering and System administration, along with 
several Microsoft certifications: Cloud, secuirty, Windows Server, Windows 10, Mobile Device Management and more. During my academic career, I have been known as the "Energizer Bunny"
because I always like to be on "go go go" status and I have high octane-levels of energy and endurance. One of my hobbies are writing computer code, work on projects, pursue technical certifications, travel, and anything else. My paradise work environment is to do IT-related work at beach while having my Pina Coladas. Overall, I always enjoy working on computers. I have built of my one servers from installation of the operating system to Advance network configurations such Virtual Private Networks.
- There is quite a few Powerscripts I have built to automate data migration process and deletion. The scripts I have written were for private companies and government sector. I have created these automation scripts because when I have migrate masses amounts of files to other locations, it became tedious and time consuming.
