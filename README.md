- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Sanchez
- 👀 I have Master's in Cybersecurity Management and Data Analytics, Bachelor's in Cybersecurity, Associate's in Computer Network Engineering and System administration, along with 
five Microsoft certifications: Cloud, secuirty, Windows Server, Windows 10, and Mobile Device Management. During my academic career, I have been known as the "Energizer Bunny"
because I always like to be on "go go go" status and I have high octane-levels of energy and endurance. One of my hobbies are writing computer code, work on projects, pursue technical certifications, travel, and anything else. My paradise work environment is to do IT-related work at beach while having my Pina Coladas. Overall, I always enjoy working on computers. I have built of my one servers from installation of the operating system to Advance network configurations such Virtual Private Networks.
- 🌱Some of the things that I am currently learning is PowerShell. I am currently working at KPFF Consulting Engineer and one of recent achievements that I have accomplished was I wrote my first PowerShell script from scratch. The purpose of the script is to automate software installation to computers and reduce amount of time require to build fully functional computer. So, far I like PowerShell and how it works.
